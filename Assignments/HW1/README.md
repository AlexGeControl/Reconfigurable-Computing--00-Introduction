### EX1 Relationship between Minimum I and Cluster Size N & LUT Size K
**Based on the experiments described in the Betz and Ahmed papers, what can you summarize about I for a given N if K=4? 
What happens if the value of K is changed?**

**ANS**: In order to use at least 98% of the LUTs inside the cluster, for given cluster of N BLEs and each BLE of LUT of size K, 
the minimum number of inputs I is determined through simulation with *logic optimization, technology mapping and logic placement* as follows:


    I = (K / 2) * (N + 1)
    
 
This agrees very well with previous results for K = 4, that is, the minimum I should be 2 * N + 2, which is (4 / 2) * (N + 1).

### EX2 Area Cost Composition
**Where are most of the transistors located in the FPGA, in the logic or in the interconnect? 
Explain why Fc should be less for larger cluster sizes.**

---

### EX3 Area Cost Calculation
**Using the transistor area estimation approaches used in class for a multiplexer, lookup table, and flip flop determine exactly how transistors that make up a single logic cluster are allocated for N = 6, I = 12. 
Include equations to determine this area for the LUTs, flip flops, and LUT input multiplexers using parameters such as N, K, and I. 
Use the equations to determine the count for the logic block. Show your numerical results in a table and explain each equation in a few sentences.**

### EX4 Area Cost of Feedback
**How would the above equations be changed if the BLE outputs did not feed back into the input multiplexers? 
Calculate the modified transistor count for the logic block based on these modified equations.**

### EX5 Input Multiplexer Size
**How many transistors are needed to implement I logic cluster input multiplexers and associated programming bits as a function of I, Fc and W?**

### EX6 Embedded Memory Block Size
**Based on our discussion in class, how many transistors are needed to build a 2KÃ—8 memory block without input or output flip flops? 
Based on your area analysis earlier (Q3), how many N = 6, I = 12 logic blocks (with feedback) are needed to fit the same transistor count. 
You can ignore the transistors in the address decoders for the memory block in your analysis.**
